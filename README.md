#### Through the usage and tutorials by https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x?tab=readme-ov-file :
##### How to make your own Physics Engine.



### Base Idea: 
The Production of a 2d physics engine from scratch

### Why/Motivation: 
The Simple premise of a physics engine on paper is a lot more difficult in actual practice, as the requirements include a good foundation and understanding of vectors on usable level, and the idea sounds fun and promising 

### How: 
Most of the applications that I learned form class is the Logic of certain coding languages, as one language’s logic can be used in a another language, just the writing and the structure that goes into it is different, though my familiarity with C++ needs refreshing, and relearning how to write in C++ more comfortably is paramount, so I’m technically learning a new language again as I Primarily Use Python or HTML/CSS/JS for web apps etc.


### Milestones:

- Structures defined icluding inheritance elements
  - Vec
  - Vec2
  - Circle
  - AABB/Rectangle
  - Object
- Collision/edge detection between objects
- Impulse resolution, the idea of reactions/actions of two objects after a collision based on mass, velocity, shape etc.
- Collision Resolve
- ObjectvsObject(CirclevsAABB, CirclevsCircle, AABBvsAABB)
-
